**Pharmaceutical Market Expansion Analysis Report**  
Using World Happiness Report & Economic Freedom Index from 2019  

**Project Summary:**  
This analysis identifies optimal markets for antidepressant expansion by evaluating countries with strong economies (high GDP), stable governance (low corruption), and robust social support, but moderate happiness scores (around 7.0 - suggesting unmet mental health needs. Using World Happiness Report and Economic Freedom Index data from 2019, we target nations where socioeconomic conditions favor healthcare investment while indicating potential demand gaps. The goal is to prioritize risk-averse, high-potential markets for pharmaceutical growth.  
  
Our objective is to identify optimal countries for antidepressant sales expansion based on: 
  
✅ Economic stability (High GDP per capita, business freedom)  
✅ Governance (Low corruption perception)  
✅ Social support (Strong community networks)  
✅ Moderate happiness scores (Potential unmet mental health needs)  
  
**Business Case:**  
We aim to expand antidepressant sales in stable, high-potential markets by analyzing the World Happiness Report & Economic Freedom Index from 2019. Targeting countries with:  
  
✅ Strong economies (High GDP per capita)  
✅ Low corruption (Stable governance)  
✅ Robust social support (Healthcare access)  
✅ Moderate happiness scores (7, suggesting unmet mental health needs).  
  
**Hypothesis:**   
"Countries with high GDP, low corruption, and strong social support—but middling happiness scores (5.0–6.5)—represent optimal markets for antidepressant sales due to unmet mental health needs despite favorable
socioeconomic conditions."
