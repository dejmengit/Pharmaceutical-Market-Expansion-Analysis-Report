**Pharmaceutical Market Expansion Analysis Report**
Using World Happiness Report & Economic Freedom Index from 2019  

Our objective is to identify optimal countries for antidepressant sales expansion based on:  
✅ Economic stability (High GDP per capita, business freedom)  
✅ Governance (Low corruption perception)  
✅ Social support (Strong community networks)  
✅ Moderate happiness scores (Potential unmet mental health needs)  
  
**Business Case:**
We aim to expand antidepressant sales in stable, high-potential markets by analyzing the World Happiness Report & Economic Freedom Index from 2019. Targeting countries with:  
✅ Strong economies (High GDP per capita)  
✅ Low corruption (Stable governance)  
✅ Robust social support (Healthcare access)  
✅ Moderate happiness scores (7, suggesting unmet mental health needs).  
  
Possible Hypothesis: 
"Countries with high GDP, low corruption, and strong social support—but middling happiness scores (5.0–6.5)—represent optimal markets for antidepressant sales due to unmet mental health needs despite favorable
socioeconomic conditions."
